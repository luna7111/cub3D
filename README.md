# cub3D

Cub3D is a lightweight ray-casting engine that renders 3D enviroments from 2D text based-maps, similar to [Wolfenstein 3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D#Development)'s.

## Overview

The program renders a real-time 3D representation of a 2D map defined in a text-based input file. You can move freely through the environment, with solid walls and basic collision detection.
